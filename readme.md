this is a readme

1. git init - Initializes repo
    - All files become "Untracked" files
    - Always have your files on "Autosave", so that your files are saved locally before staging.

2. Stage Changes: git add . (add in all untracked files to git) or type git add about.html to add a specific file
    - All files are "Added" files to the staging area

3. Commit Changes: Save the added files as my work on Git by committing with a message: using 
    - git commit -m "changes made as a message"
    - We can also commit our changes via our Source control feature on VSCode

4. Github: create a github repo on your github account

5. Push to Github: Upload to my Github repo (if connected) all files added to the staging area using: 
    - git push -u origin main
